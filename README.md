# Power BI Report Server vs. SSRS – Which One Should You Choose? 

Microsoft offers two powerful reporting solutions for organizations that prefer on-premises deployment: Power BI Report Server (PBIRS) and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). But which one fits your needs best? 🤔

✨ Power BI Report Server (PBIRS) – The best of both worlds!
✅ Supports interactive Power BI reports (.pbix) and paginated reports (.rdl)
✅ Works well with on-prem and cloud data sources
✅ Ideal for companies that want Power BI functionality without moving to the cloud
✅ Requires Power BI Premium or SQL Server Enterprise with SA

📊 SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) – The traditional enterprise reporting tool!
✅ Designed for paginated, pixel-perfect reports
✅ Best suited for SQL Server-based reporting
✅ No cloud dependency, fully on-premises
✅ Comes free with SQL Server Standard/Enterprise

🔎 So, which one should you choose?
👉 If you need interactive dashboards with Power BI reports on-premises, go for PBIRS.
👉 If you need only traditional paginated reports, SSRS is enough.
